# WhatTimeIsItThere
 What Time Is It There is an android application that displays your friends’ information, primarily their local time and date, to make sure you don’t disturb them at odd hours. It also sends notifications when it is your friend's birthday in their timezone, so that you can be the first one to wish them.

The application is written in Kotlin and XML. It uses Databinding and Binding Adapters to implement the Model-View-Viewmodel Architecture. Room Persistance Library was used to store the entered data in an SQLite database.
